# Task ID: 2
# Title: Restructure Codebase
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Reorganize the existing codebase into a standard Python package layout.
# Details:
Move existing code files into the new structure as outlined in the PRD. Create directories for `cli`, `core`, `api`, `models`, `utils`, and `web`. Ensure all modules are properly imported in the new structure.

# Test Strategy:
Run existing unit tests to ensure that the codebase functions correctly after restructuring.
