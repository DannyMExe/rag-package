# Task ID: 31
# Title: Set up GitHub Repository for lawfirm-rag-package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a remote GitHub repository for the LawFirm-RAG project, configure the local repository to connect to the remote origin, and push the initial codebase.
# Details:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Log in to GitHub and create a new repository named "lawfirm-rag-package"
   - Keep the repository private initially (can be changed later)
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (these already exist locally)

2. Configure the local repository to connect to the remote:
   - Navigate to the local project directory
   - Run `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/lawfirm-rag-package.git`
   - Verify the remote connection with `git remote -v`

3. Push the codebase to GitHub:
   - The local repository is already initialized with main branch, README.md, MIT License, and .gitignore
   - Ensure all necessary files are staged: `git add .`
   - Create an initial commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Initial commit: LawFirm-RAG package structure"`
   - Set the upstream branch: `git push -u origin main`
   - Verify the push was successful by checking the GitHub repository

4. Configure branch protection rules (optional):
   - Set up branch protection for the main branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging

5. Set up GitHub Actions workflow (optional):
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory
   - Add a basic CI workflow YAML file for testing

6. Update documentation with repository information:
   - Add the repository URL to the README.md if not already included
   - Include basic clone instructions for contributors

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the GitHub repository exists and is accessible:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository URL
   - Confirm the repository name matches "lawfirm-rag-package"
   - Verify repository visibility settings are as expected

2. Confirm remote configuration:
   - Run `git remote -v` in the local repository
   - Verify that the origin points to the correct GitHub URL

3. Validate the initial codebase push:
   - Check that all files from the local repository appear in the GitHub repository
   - Verify file structure matches the expected project layout
   - Confirm that the comprehensive README.md, MIT License, and Python-specific .gitignore are present
   - Confirm that .gitignore is working correctly (no unwanted files in repository)

4. Test clone functionality:
   - Clone the repository to a new location using `git clone https://github.com/username/lawfirm-rag-package.git`
   - Verify all files are correctly cloned

5. Verify branch configuration:
   - Confirm the default branch is set correctly (main)
   - Check that any branch protection rules are functioning as expected

6. Document verification:
   - Ensure README.md contains the correct repository URL
   - Verify installation instructions work when following them from the GitHub repository
