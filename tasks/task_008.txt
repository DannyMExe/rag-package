# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate AI Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the AI engine for model loading and inference, now fully implemented and integrated with advanced features for legal document analysis.
# Details:
The AI engine logic has been successfully implemented in `core/ai_engine.py`, featuring full GGUF model support and utilizing `llama-cpp-python` for improved local inference performance. It supports legal-specific document analysis and query generation, with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Test the AI engine with various legal documents to ensure it produces expected results across all implemented features, including document summarization, key points extraction, and legal issues identification.
