# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Git repository for the LawFirm-RAG project.
# Details:
Create a new directory for the project and initialize a Git repository using `git init`. Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like `__pycache__`, `.env`, and others.
