# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement CLI Entry Points
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up command-line interface entry points for the package. The CLI framework has been successfully completed with comprehensive features and modules.
# Details:
Define entry points in `pyproject.toml` for the CLI commands such as `lawfirm-rag analyze`, `lawfirm-rag query`, `lawfirm-rag serve`, `lawfirm-rag models`, and `lawfirm-rag config`. Implement the main command logic in `lawfirm_rag/cli/main.py` using the Click framework. The CLI now supports rich console output, multiple output formats, and batch processing.

# Test Strategy:
Run `lawfirm-rag --help` to ensure that the CLI commands are accessible and display the correct help information. Verify that each command functions as intended, including document analysis, query generation, web server operation, and model management.
