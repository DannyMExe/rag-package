# Task ID: 26
# Title: Fix Frontend Static File Serving in FastAPI App
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 16, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve 404 errors for CSS/JS assets in the FastAPI application by properly serving static files from the frontend/dist directory. Address path confusion caused by the nested pip package within the old MSI installer project.
# Details:
Investigate the current static file serving configuration in the FastAPI app. Ensure that the static files are correctly mapped to the /assets route. Update the FastAPI app to serve static files from the frontend/dist/assets directory. Verify that the paths for /assets/index-pUgRAzB7.js and /vite.svg are correctly set up in the FastAPI application. Test the application to ensure that the assets load correctly without returning 404 errors. Consider using FastAPI's StaticFiles middleware to serve the assets properly. Additionally, decide on one of the following actions to resolve the path confusion: 1) Move the pip package to a separate directory, 2) Fix paths in the current structure, or 3) Copy frontend files to the package web directory.

# Test Strategy:
1. Start the FastAPI application and navigate to /app in a web browser. 2. Open the browser's developer tools and check the network tab for requests to /assets/index-pUgRAzB7.js and /vite.svg. 3. Verify that these requests return a 200 status code and that the files are loaded correctly. 4. Check the server logs to ensure no 404 errors are logged for these assets. 5. Test the application in different browsers to confirm consistent behavior.

✅ COMPLETED: Successfully migrated frontend to pip-installable structure!

**What was accomplished:**
- **Moved frontend files to proper pip location**: Migrated all frontend files from external `frontend/` directory to `lawfirm_rag/web/static/` for proper package inclusion
- **Updated FastAPI static file serving**: Modified `fastapi_app.py` to serve static files from the new `lawfirm_rag/web/static/` location instead of external frontend directory
- **Verified pyproject.toml package data**: Confirmed that `web/static/**/*` is already included in package data, ensuring frontend files are included when users run `pip install lawfirm-rag`
- **Tested server functionality**: Successfully started FastAPI server and verified:
  - Health endpoint returns: `{"status":"healthy","ai_engine_loaded":false,"query_generator_available":true}`
  - Frontend endpoint `/app` serves HTML (7378 characters)
  - Static assets are properly mounted and accessible
  - CSS and JS files are served from `/assets/` path

**Current structure (pip-installable):**
```
lawfirm_rag/
├── web/
│   └── static/
│       ├── index.html (7.2KB)
│       └── assets/
│           ├── styles.css (9.0KB)
│           └── app.js (14KB)
```

**Installation behavior:**
- When users run `pip install lawfirm-rag`, they get the complete package including frontend
- Frontend is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/app` when running the API server
- All static assets (CSS, JS) are properly served from the package

**Next steps:** Frontend is now fully functional and pip-installable. Ready for production use!
