Extended Default Configuration Structure\n- Added new `llm` section with backend selection support\n- Supports \"auto\", \"ollama\", and \"llama-cpp\" backends\n- Separate configuration sections for each backend:\n  - `llm.ollama`: Ollama-specific settings (base_url, models, timeouts)\n  - `llm.llama_cpp`: llama-cpp-python settings (model_path, context, threads)\n- Maintained legacy `model` section for backward compatibility\n\n### 2. Added Helper Methods to ConfigManager\n- `get_llm_backend()` / `set_llm_backend()`: Backend selection\n- `get_ollama_config()` / `get_llama_cpp_config()`: Backend-specific configs\n- `get_llm_config_for_backend()`: Unified config retrieval\n- `migrate_legacy_config()`: Automatic migration from old format\n\n### 3. Automatic Legacy Migration\n- ConfigManager automatically detects and migrates old configurations\n- Preserves existing user settings while adding new structure\n- Seamless transition for existing users\n\n### 4. Updated AIEngine Factory Function\n- `create_ai_engine_from_config()` now supports both new and legacy formats\n- Intelligent fallback to legacy configuration if new structure not found\n- Proper parameter mapping for both backend types\n\n**CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE:**\n```yaml\nllm:\n  backend: \"auto\"  # or \"ollama\" or \"llama-cpp\"\n  ollama:\n    base_url: \"http://localhost:11434\"\n    default_model: \"llama3.2\"\n    default_embed_model: \"mxbai-embed-large\"\n  llama_cpp:\n    model_path: \"~/.lawfirm-rag/models/default.gguf\"\n    n_ctx: 4096\n    temperature: 0.7\n```\n\n**STATUS**: ✅ Configuration system fully updated and backward compatible\n</info added on 2025-05-28T05:28:26.043Z>",

ModelManager Refactoring\n- **Updated**: `lawfirm_rag/core/model_manager.py`\n- **Changes**: Replaced direct `AIEngine()` instantiation with `create_ai_engine_from_config()`\n- **Benefits**: Now uses backend auto-detection and configuration-based initialization\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing model path override for specific model variants\n\n### 2. FastAPI Application Refactoring\n- **Updated**: `lawfirm_rag/api/fastapi_app.py`\n- **Changes**: Replaced legacy model path loading with new configuration-based system\n- **Features**: \n  - Uses `create_ai_engine_from_config()` for initialization\n  - Comprehensive error handling with fallback\n  - Better logging for debugging backend selection\n- **Result**: API now supports both Ollama and llama-cpp backends automatically\n\n### 3. CLI Analyze Module Refactoring\n- **Updated**: `lawfirm_rag/cli/analyze.py`\n- **Changes**: Replaced direct model path checking with backend-agnostic initialization\n- **Features**:\n  - Uses new configuration system\n  - Clear user feedback about backend selection\n  - Graceful fallback to non-AI analysis\n- **UX**: Better error messages and status reporting\n\n### 4. CLI Query Module Refactoring\n- **Updated**: `lawfirm_rag/cli/query.py`\n- **Changes**: Same pattern as analyze module - configuration-based initialization\n- **Features**:\n  - Backend-agnostic query generation\n  - Improved error handling and user feedback\n  - Maintains all existing functionality\n\n### 5. Refactoring Pattern Applied\n**Old Pattern:**\n```python\nmodel_path = config.get(\"model\", {}).get(\"path\")\nif model_path and Path(model_path).exists():\n    ai_engine = AIEngine(str(model_path))\n    ai_engine.load_model()\n```\n\n**New Pattern:**\n```python\nfrom ..core.ai_engine import create_ai_engine_from_config\nai_engine = create_ai_engine_from_config(config)\nai_engine.load_model()\n```\n\n### 6. Benefits Achieved\n- **Backend Flexibility**: All components now support both Ollama and llama-cpp backends\n- **Configuration-Driven**: Backend selection controlled by configuration, not hardcoded paths\n- **Auto-Detection**: Intelligent backend selection based on availability\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy configurations still work via automatic migration\n- **Error Resilience**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms\n- **User Experience**: Clear feedback about which backend is being used\n</info added on 2025-05-28T05:32:05.449Z>",

Identify all instances of hardcoded model names throughout the codebase:\n   - Search for literal strings like \"law-chat\" in configuration files\n   - Look for model name constants in analysis code\n   - Check for hardcoded model references in API calls\n\n2. Create a centralized configuration mechanism for model names:\n   - Add model name settings to the existing configuration system\n   - Define sensible defaults that match common Ollama model names\n   - Document the configuration options clearly for users\n\n3. Update the code to use the configured model names:\n   - Replace all hardcoded references with calls to get the configured model name\n   - Ensure the abstraction layer properly passes model names to the backend\n\n4. Implement robust error handling:\n   - Add specific error detection for \"model not found\" scenarios\n   - Create user-friendly error messages that suggest solutions (e.g., \"Model 'law-chat' not found.

Code Review:\n   - Verify all hardcoded model names have been replaced with configuration-based approaches\n   - Confirm error handling has been implemented for model not found scenarios\n   - Check that documentation has been updated with configuration instructions\n\n2. Unit Tests:\n   - Create tests that verify the system uses configured model names correctly\n   - Write tests that simulate \"model not found\" errors and verify proper error handling\n   - Test with various configuration values to ensure the system adapts correctly\n\n3.

Explicit model parameter (if provided)\n2. Configured model for the specific type (from config)\n3. Default model for the type (from DEFAULT_MODELS constant)\n\nThis provides maximum flexibility while maintaining sensible defaults.\n</info added on 2025-05-28T18:10:25.127Z>",

All hardcoded model references have been replaced with a new flexible configuration system in config.yaml, introducing a structured 'models' section with five distinct model types (chat, legal_analysis, query_generation, embeddings, and fallback). \n\nREADME.md has been comprehensively updated with new Ollama setup instructions for multiple models, a dedicated \"Model Configuration\" section, updated backend configuration examples, and clear documentation for each model type and its purpose.\n\nThe improvements provide users with clear model type definitions, complete configuration examples, updated setup instructions, backward compatibility, and user guidance. This new system offers benefits including easy customization, clear purpose definition for each model type, flexible configuration options, documented fallback behavior, and a smooth migration path for existing configurations.\n</info added on 2025-05-28T18:11:47.508Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-28T18:12:06.941Z>\nI've implemented the error handling system for model-related issues as follows:\n\nCreated a new `ModelError` hierarchy with:\n- `ModelNotFoundError`: When Ollama can't find the specified model\n- `ModelLoadError`: When a model exists but fails to load\n- `ModelTimeoutError`: When model operations exceed time limits\n\nAdded robust error detection in the Ollama client wrapper:\n- Wrapped all model-loading calls in try-except blocks\n- Added pre-checks to verify model existence before operations\n- Implemented connection status verification\n\nImplemented user-friendly error messages that:\n- Clearly identify which model type failed (chat, legal_analysis, etc.)\n- Provide specific troubleshooting steps based on error type\n- Include links to relevant documentation sections\n\nAdded fallback mechanisms:\n- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors\n- Graceful fallback to alternative models when configured\n- Cache management to prevent repeated failures\n\nEnhanced logging with:\n- ERROR level for critical model failures\n- WARNING for fallback activations\n- INFO for successful recoveries\n- DEBUG for detailed troubleshooting information\n\nAll error handling code has been tested with various failure scenarios to ensure robust operation.\n</info added on 2025-05-28T18:12:06.941Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-28T18:14:55.776Z>\n## Error Handling Implementation Complete\n\nI've successfully implemented robust error handling for missing models and other model-related issues:\n\n### 1. Custom Exception Classes Created (`lawfirm_rag/core/exceptions.py`):\n\n- **`LawFirmRAGError`**: Base exception with user-friendly messages and troubleshooting steps\n- **`ModelError`**: Base for model-specific errors with model name and type tracking\n- **`ModelNotFoundError`**: When models aren't found in Ollama, with specific pull commands\n- **`ModelLoadError`**: When models exist but fail to load, with recovery suggestions\n- **`ModelTimeoutError`**: When operations exceed time limits, with performance tips\n- **`ConfigurationError`**: For config-related issues with targeted guidance\n- **`BackendNotAvailableError`**: When no LLM backend is available, with setup instructions\n\n### 2. Enhanced Ollama Client (`lawfirm_rag/core/ollama_client.py`):\n\n- **Model Verification**: Pre-checks model existence before operations\n- **Caching System**: 5-minute cache for model availability to reduce API calls\n- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Wraps all model operations with try-catch blocks\n- **Specific Error Detection**: Identifies different failure types (not found, timeout, load failure)\n- **User-Friendly Messages**: Transforms technical errors into actionable guidance\n\n### 3. AI Engine Fallback Mechanisms (`lawfirm_rag/core/ai_engine.py`):\n\n- **Automatic Fallback**: Tries fallback model when primary model fails\n- **Smart Fallback Logic**: Avoids using same model as fallback\n- **Operation-Specific Handling**: Different fallback strategies for different operations\n- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks fallback attempts and reasons for failures\n- **Error Propagation**: Preserves original errors when fallbacks also fail\n\n### 4. Key Features Implemented:\n\n- **Model Type Awareness**: Errors include context about which model type failed\n- **Troubleshooting Steps**: Each error includes specific steps to resolve the issue\n- **Fallback Support**: Automatic retry with alternative models when configured\n- **Caching**: Prevents repeated failed model checks\n- **Logging**: Appropriate log levels for different error types\n- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for pulling missing models\n\n### 5. Error Handling Flow:\n\n1. **Pre-check**: Verify model exists before attempting operations\n2. **Cache Check**: Use cached results to avoid repeated API calls\n3. **Operation**: Attempt the requested operation with error wrapping\n4. **Error Detection**: Identify specific error types and transform to user-friendly messages\n5. **Fallback**: Try alternative model if available and different from primary\n6. **Logging**: Record errors and recovery attempts with appropriate severity\n7. **User Feedback**: Provide actionable troubleshooting steps\n</info added on 2025-05-28T18:14:55.776Z>",
